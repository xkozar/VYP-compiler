super reference
wrong symbols in dot notation
check constructor is void type and takes void parameter only
built-in methods
MAKEFILE set path to antlr

NICE TO HAVE:
object type casting (runtime check) and check objects to it's subclasses
variable overlapping(shadowing)
variables cant have same name as functions and classes
lexical errors
